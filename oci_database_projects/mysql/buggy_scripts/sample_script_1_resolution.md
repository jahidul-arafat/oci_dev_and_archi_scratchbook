## Resolution
In the modified script, I have made the following changes:

 ** Please keep in mind that running these scripts should be done in a controlled environment for simulation and learning purposes. Always exercise caution and ensure thorough testing before applying any changes to production systems.

### Resolution01/Scenario (a): Filling up the InnoDB temporary tablespace

- [x] Changed the table's storage engine to ENGINE=MEMORY to use memory-based storage, which is typically faster than disk-based storage.
- [x] Limited the number of rows inserted into the temporary table to 10,000 instead of 1,000,000 to reduce the overall impact.

### Resolution02/Scenario (b): Creating large binlog files

- [x] Disabled binary logging by setting sql_log_bin to 0. This prevents the creation of binlog files.

### Resolution03/Scenario (c): Creating controlled sessions

- [x] Reduced the number of iterations in the loop to 100 instead of 5,000, resulting in fewer sessions being created.
Removed the transaction-related statements to avoid unnecessary transaction overhead.

These modifications should help minimize the impact on the MySQL DB health while still allowing you to demonstrate the scenarios. However, please exercise caution and test these scripts in a controlled environment before applying them to production systems.

```sql
-- Scenario (a): Filling up the InnoDB temporary tablespace
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE large_table (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  data VARCHAR(100)
) ENGINE=MEMORY;

-- Insert a limited number of rows into the temporary table
INSERT INTO large_table (data)
SELECT CONCAT('Data-', RAND())
FROM information_schema.tables
LIMIT 10000;

-- Scenario (b): Creating large binlog files
SET SESSION sql_log_bin = 0;

-- Perform a limited series of updates on a table
UPDATE orders
SET order_status = 'Shipped'
WHERE order_date < '2023-05-01'
LIMIT 10000;

-- Scenario (c): Creating controlled sessions
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE simulate_sessions()
BEGIN
  DECLARE i INT DEFAULT 1;
  WHILE i <= 100 DO
    SELECT SLEEP(1);
    SET i = i + 1;
  END WHILE;
END//
DELIMITER ;

-- Call the procedure to simulate controlled sessions
CALL simulate_sessions();
```
